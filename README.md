## Purpose-
1. I created this repository to push code and solved question and snippets in C++ as I started learning Data Structures and Algorithms and give anyone in need a glance or reference to it.
2. I will be pushing the **Implementations and Questions of DSA** as I progress.

### Data Structures as of now-
1. [Stack](https://github.com/RichardTimothy1307/DSA_in_cpp/tree/master/stack)
2. [Queue](https://github.com/RichardTimothy1307/DSA_in_CPP/tree/master/Queue)
3. [Linked List](https://github.com/RichardTimothy1307/DSA_in_CPP/tree/master/Linked_List)
